There is some data on Nautilus App Server 3 in Stratos DC. Data needs to be altered in several of the files. On Nautilus App Server 3, alter the /home/BSD.txt file as per details given below:

a. Delete all lines containing word following and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file. (Please be aware of case sensitivity)

b. Replace all occurrence of word from to their and save results in /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt file.

Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter any words containing this string; for example upto, contributor etc.
==================================================================>
a) grep -v "following" BSD.txt > BSD_DELETE.txt
Explanation:

    grep -v: This command searches for lines not containing the specified word.
    "following": The word to be searched and deleted.
    >: Redirects the output to a new file "BSD_DELETE.txt."
b)sed 's/\bfrom\b/their/g' BSD.txt > BSD_REPLACE.txt
Explanation:

    sed: Stream Editor for filtering and transforming text.
    's/\bfrom\b/their/g': This is the substitution command in sed.
        \b: Word boundary, ensures that only whole words "from" are matched.
        g: Global flag to replace all occurrences on each line.
    >: Redirects the output to a new file "BSD_REPLACE.txt."
