A developer named anita has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for anita. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.


Therefore, create a user named anita on the App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set expiry date to 2021-03-28. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.
===============================================================>
sudo useradd -m -d /home/anita -e 2021-03-28 anita
